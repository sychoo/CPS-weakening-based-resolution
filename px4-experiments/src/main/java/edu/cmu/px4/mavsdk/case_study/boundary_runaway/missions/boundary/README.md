# Boundary Enforcer Case Study
Before taking-off, create a cube around the origin (designated location coordinates and altitude), using configurable parameters like x_low, x_upper, y_low, y_upper, z_low, z_upper to bound it

then execute specialized mission, to fly east of the bounding box (to escape the bounding box by going east). see the drone struggle.
