- somehow encode the time bound in the MILP encoding
    - by modifying the AST emitEncoding function
    - using a decision variable in a place of time?
    - when finding the extrema of the subRhoVars

- add weakening clause
    - G[0, 1](<<battery > 10%>>(delta_battery, 5%))
    - meaning that the atomic proposition `battery > 10%` can be weakened up to 5%, with the resulting weakened amount stored in the decision variable `delta_battery`.

- play around with simulator
    - 30x12 (width x height)

- environmental model
    - encode x_pos y_pos

- for the dragonfly simulator, structure the simulator so that features are first-class citizens, structurally modify the simulator? (too much work?)
